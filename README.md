# GPU_static_clock
2 bat  files to set and unset a static gpu clock rate. To fix nvidia broadcast audio crackling in cases where the clock rate variates too much.




### Current max graphics clock set for my "MSI RTX 5080 Gaming Trio" in set_gpu_clock.bat:


```set GRAPHICS_CLOCK=2715```


Change this to your max available clock rate for your gpu.
